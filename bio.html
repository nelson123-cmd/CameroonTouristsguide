  <h1>ABOUT SENGLA NELSON - Founder of Cameroon Tourist Guide</h1>
  <a class="back-button" href="index.html">‚Üê Back to Home</a>

  <p>My name is <span class="highlight">Sengla Nelson</span>, and I come from the heart of the North West Region of Cameroon. Born into humble beginnings, my journey has been one of resilience, courage, and an unshakable love for my country and its people.</p>

  <p>I was raised by my grandparents in a small, peaceful village, after my mother‚Äîwho was still a student at the time‚Äîfaced challenges that led my family to make the difficult decision to have me brought up in their care. I spent my early years in Kumbo, where I completed primary school. After that, I reunited with my mother to pursue secondary education. Life, however, had other plans.</p>

  <p>My mother, though loving and determined, was financially unstable and already caring for more children. My grandfather, who had carried the burden for years, could no longer afford to continue supporting my education. I was just 12 years old, but I knew I had to take control of my destiny.</p>

  <p>With nothing but hope and a strong will, I left for the city. I worked countless odd jobs in Bamenda, Douala, and Yaound√©‚Äîfrom street hustles to cleaning and selling in markets‚Äîjust to survive and save for my dream of going back to school. It was never easy. For eight long years, I fought through poverty, rejection, and the harsh realities of life. But I never lost sight of my goal: to one day earn a university degree.</p>

  <p>Eventually, I returned to school and earned my O-Level and A-Level certificates. My dream continued at the University of Dschang, where I enrolled to study Law, driven by my passion for justice and the desire to be a voice for the voiceless‚Äîespecially for the marginalized Anglophone community.</p>

  <p>However, during the height of the Anglophone Crisis in 2022, my journey was cut short. Due to my active involvement in student movements and peaceful advocacy for equality, I faced severe threats and pressure. For my safety, I was forced to drop out. It was a heartbreaking moment, but not the end of my story.</p>

  <h2>üß≠ Why I Became a Tourist Guide</h2>

  <p>Out of the challenges I faced, a new passion was born. I realized that beyond politics and education, I had a deep love for Cameroon‚Äîits cultures, people, and breathtaking landscapes. I wanted to connect with people from all over the world, to showcase the beauty of my country and tell stories that aren‚Äôt always heard.</p>

  <p>Becoming a tourist guide is not just a job for me‚Äîit is a calling. I find joy in introducing visitors to the majestic highlands of the North West, the waterfalls of the West, the vibrant cities, and the rich traditions that define us as a people. Through this work, I continue to serve my country, not just as a guide, but as a cultural ambassador.</p>

  <p>It also aligns with my long-term political and social ambitions. Guiding tourists allows me to better understand the realities of different regions and communities in Cameroon, strengthening my dream of one day contributing to the development and unity of our nation.</p>

  <h2>üí° Today, through Cameroon Tourist Guide, I aim to:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Help people from around the world discover the true Cameroon, beyond what the media shows.</li>
    <li>Empower local communities through tourism and cultural exchange.</li>
    <li>Share my story to inspire others who are facing hardship never to give up.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is more than tourism. It's a journey of hope, healing, and human connection.</p>

  <p><strong>Welcome to my world. Welcome to Cameroon.</strong></p>
